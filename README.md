## About

Downloads all of the card images from netrunnercards.info and puts them into a local "Sets/" directory which you can copy over to your OCTGN directory.

**ONLY USE THIS TOOL IF YOU HAVE PURCHASED ALL OF THE CARDS.**

In the future, I will make each data pack optional so that you can install only those sets that you own.

## Thanks

Thanks to netrunnercards.info for a wonderful API and to FFG for a wonderful game.
